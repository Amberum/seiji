Toronto Symphony Orchestra Boston Symphony Orchestra Saito Kinen Orchestra Suntory Music Award Seiji Ozawa 
(小澤 征爾, Ozawa Seiji, September 1, 1935 – February 6, 2024) was a Japanese conductor known internationally for his work 
as music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, and especially the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), 
where he served from 1973 for 29 years. After conducting the Vienna New Year's Concert in 2002, he was 
director of the Vienna State Opera until 2010. In Japan, he founded the Saito Kinen Orchestra in 1984, their festival in 1992, 
and the Tokyo Opera Nomori in 2005. Ozawa rose to fame after he won the 1959 Besançon competition and was invited by Charles Munch, 
then the music director of the BSO, for the following year to Tanglewood, the orchestra's summer home, where he studied with Munch 
and Pierre Monteux. Winning the festival's Koussevitzky Prize earned him a scholarship with Herbert von Karajan and the 
Berlin Philharmonic and brought him to the attention of Leonard Bernstein, who made him his assistant with the New York Philharmonic in 1961.
Ozawa conducted world premieres such as György Ligeti's San Francisco Polyphony in 1975 and Olivier Messiaen's opera 
Saint François d'Assise in Paris in 1983. Ozawa was the first Japanese conductor recognized internationally and the only 
one of superstar status.[1] Ozawa was born on September 1, 1935, to Japanese parents in the Japanese-occupied Manchurian city of Mukden, 
now known as Shenyang in China.[2][3][4] He began piano lessons at age seven.[1] When his family returned to Japan in 1944, 
he began studying piano with Noboru Toyomasu, with a focus on the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Hideo Saito, his teacher 
at the Toho Gakuen School of Music, brought him to a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5, ultimately 
shifting his musical focus from piano performance to conducting. He studied conducting and composition, achieving first 
prizes in both fields, and worked with the NHK Symphony Orchestra and the Japan Philharmonic while still a student.[1] 
He graduated in 1957.[2][5] Ozawa travelled to Europe for further studies; he supported himself by selling Japanese motor 
scooters.[1] He achieved the first prize at the 1959 International Competition of Orchestra Conductors in Besançon, France, 
which made him known internationally;[1][6] Charles Munch, then the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, 
invited him to attend the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center) the following year to study with Munch 
and Pierre Monteux.[1] Shortly after his arrival there, Ozawa won the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductor, 
Tanglewood's highest honor, which earned him a scholarship to study conducting with Herbert von Karajan.[1] From 1964 until 1968,
Ozawa served as the first music director of the Ravinia Festival,[1] the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1967,
he was commissioned by Koussevitzky to compose Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony, which was performed by Bernstein for the first time 
with the BSO. In Ozawa's first North American version, Yvonne Loriod is the pianist who appears for the first time. [10] [11] [12] 
The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. [13] When it was reissued on CD in 2004, one reviewer said: "The tenth edition 
still packs a punch, and frankly, despite the many new editions that have been released, it remains one of the best. "[14] 
The composer composed his first opera "Saint-François of Assisi" for Ozawa in Paris in 1983. [11] A 1992 recording of

School of Music Orchestra and members of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra with solo cello Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi and 
solo violist Nobuko Imai in a world-wide telecast (carried on the PBS television network in the United States) 
from the United Nations building in New York City.[19] The concert included a work by Beethoven and Strauss's Don Quixote 
with the two Japanese soloists. In December 1979, Ozawa conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the 
Beijing Symphony Orchestra.[20] This was the first time since 1961 that the symphony was performed live in the People's Republic 
of China due to a ban on Western music.[20] Ozawa conducted an orchestra and singers in Nagano, and was joined by choruses 
singing from Beijing, Berlin, Cape Town, New York City, and Sydney – as well as the crowd in the Nagano Olympic Stadium. 
On New Year's Day 2002, Ozawa conducted the first Japanese New Year's concert in Vienna.[2] In 2002, he left the position 
of music director of the BSO to become general director of the Vienna State Opera. He conducted Verdi's Ernani and 
Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1988, Pique Dame in 1992 and Verdi's Falstaff in 1993, and began his tenure with 
Janáček's Jenůfa and Krenek's Jonny spielt auf. In 2005, he created Tokyo Opera Nomori [fr] and directed 
Richard Strauss's . Ozawa left the Vienna State Opera in 2010 and was replaced by Franz Welser-Möst. 
He was married to her from 1968 until his death in 2024.[1] The couple had two children, a daughter named 
Sayla and a son named Yukiyoshi. During his time with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Ozawa chose to split 
his time between Boston and Tokyo rather than move his family to the United States. This was because he and 
his wife wanted their children to grow up with an awareness of Japanese tradition.[34] On January 7, 2010, 
Ozawa announced that he would cancel all work for six months due to treatment for his esophageal cancer.[27] 
At the time of the announcement, Ozawa's doctor stated that the disease was discovered at an early stage.[36][37] 
Ozawa's other health issues included pneumonia,[27] and lower back problems that required surgery in 2011.[27][38] 
Following his cancer diagnosis, Ozawa and author Haruki Murakami began a six-part conversation series on classical music, 
the basis of his book Absolutely on Music.[1][39] "Musicians develop unique tastes as they get older," Haruki Murakami 
said in a 2016 interview book.
